Hi, I'm **Patrick**, a **passionate product manager** with over 10 years' experience in building software tools for automotive software engineers. 

My two key interests are 

1. **building software-based products** that do not suck, but ones **that users really, really like using**
2. **linking the customer value** delivered by the products (or services) **to prices and sales argumentations** that **convince customers** to invest and purchase, ultimately resulting in **profitable businesses**

On this site, I share **my experiences**, **personal views** as well as **methods and tools that I have adopted or developed**. 

Feel free to get in touch via email, linkedin or Twitter.
