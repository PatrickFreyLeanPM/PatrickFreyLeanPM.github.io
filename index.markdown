Hi, I'm **Patrick**, a **passionate product manager** with over 10 years' experience in building software tools for automotive software engineers. 

My two key interests are 

1. **building software-based products** that users **really like using**
2. **linking the customer value** delivered by the products (or services) **to prices and sales argumentations** that **convince customers** to invest and purchase, ultimately resulting in **profitable businesses**

On this site, I share [**my experiences**, **personal views**]({% link blog.markdown %}) as well as [**methods and tools that I have adopted or developed**]({% link custom_methods_tools.markdown %}). 

Feel free to get in touch via [email](mailto:patrick-frey@gmx.de), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/freypatrick) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/patrickcfrey).
