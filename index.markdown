Hi, I'm Patrick, a passionate product manager with over 10 years' experience in building software tools for automotive software engineers. 

Let's be honest: most automotive software engineering tools suck. 
One reason typically raised is that the domain is very technical and special. My personal opinion is that there is often a lack of focus of what users who work with the tools really need. 

My primary focus is thus on building engineering tools that do not suck, but ones that users really, really like using.
