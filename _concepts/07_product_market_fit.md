Product-market fit refers to the stage in a product's development where it aligns seamlessly with the needs and preferences of a specific target market. It signifies that the product addresses a significant problem for the intended customers and delivers value that resonates with them.

The term "Product-Market Fit" was coined by entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, in his blog post ["The Only Thing That Matters"](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html) published in 2007. 

**Examples of Product-Market Fit:**

2. **E-commerce App:** An e-commerce app that consistently meets the shopping preferences and demands of its target customers, resulting in frequent and repeat purchases, demonstrates product-market fit.
