Recently, a colleague shared some very interesting insights on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/felix-hieronymi-50455a135_a-plan-is-not-a-strategy-activity-7145703428135034880-PfIO?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) about strategy development.

The post contained a video from Roger Martin **A Plan Is Not a Strategy**. Here's the video by Roger Martin:

There are a couple of very interesting insights for me personally as I did not make the distinction between **strategy** and **plan** very much clear in my own writing about [Strategy]({{site.url}}/concepts/02_strategy.html). The key insight for me is that the definition of **strategy** by Roger Martin very much conforms to what [Itamar Gilad](https://itamargilad.com/) teaches in his product management workshops.
