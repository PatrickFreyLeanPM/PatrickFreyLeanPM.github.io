I got a new follower on Twitter today ([@NilsDavis](https://twitter.com/NilsDavis){:target="_blank"}), and it turns out he is he is a product management veteran himself and runs a series of interesting resources (website, podcast, etc.).

Especially the introduction to "What does a product manager do?" is a good read for anyone not into product management yet or who is struggeling on interpreting this role.
