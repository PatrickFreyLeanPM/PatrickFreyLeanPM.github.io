Over the past 10 years, I have adopted and even developed a couple of methods and supporting tools that have helped me to create a successful B2B business at an existing large corporation. 

As the methods and tools have served me well, my goal is to share these with others to help them increasing their odds to succeed. 

* Prioritizing development efforts with help of the [**CUBUDE prioritization method**]({% link methods_and_tools/cubude.markdown %})
* Deriving prices and sales argumentations by means of [**value-based pricing**]({% link methods_and_tools/value_based_pricing.markdown %}), a [**pricing method**]({% link methods_and_tools/pricing_methods.markdown %}) that is superior to others and integrates very well with approaches and methods used in new product development.
