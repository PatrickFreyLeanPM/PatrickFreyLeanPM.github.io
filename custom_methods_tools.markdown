Over the past 10 years, I have adopted and even developed a couple of methods and tools that have helped me to create a successful B2B business at an existing large corporation. 

As the methods and tools have served me well, my goal is to share these with others to help them increasing their odds to succeed. 

* Prioritizing development efforts with help of the **CUBUDE prioritization method** 
* Deriving prices and sales argumentations by means of **value-based pricing (VBP)**
