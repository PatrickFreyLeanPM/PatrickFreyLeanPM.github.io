Over the past 10 years, I have **tried out** a lot of methods, **adopted many** of them and even **developed** a set of **own methods and supporting tools** that have helped me to create a **successful new B2B business** at an existing large corporation. 

As the methods and tools have served me well, I want to share them to help others increasing their odds to succeed. 

<!--
## Own proven methods

* **Prioritizing** development efforts with help of the [CUBUDE prioritization method]({% link methods_and_tools/cubude.markdown %})
* **Deriving prices and sales argumentations** by means of [value-based pricing]({% link methods_and_tools/value_based_pricing.markdown %}), a [pricing method]({% link methods_and_tools/pricing_methods.markdown %}) that is deemed superior to other pricing and integrates very well with approaches and methods used in new product development.
