Agile methods such as [Scrum](https://scrumguides.org/){:target="_blank"} and Kanban have been adopted widely over the past years, especially in software development. 

In Scrum, for example, the [product backlog](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-product-backlog){:target="_blank"} is the central repository of all work that should be done in the future by the team who is working on the product. 
<!--A backlog is a priorized list of issues such as epics, user stories or tasks.-->

## The challenge of prioritizing

In theory, the product backlog is a prioritized list of work items where the first item has the highest priority, followed by second, etc.

But how to prioritize a set of work items? 

What should actually come first, second, third? Why? 

Whatâ€™s the motivation and reasoning behind the prioritization? 

How can you explain or even defend the prioritization? 

What are the objectives behind the prioritization?

## The CUBUDE method

The method is fundamentally based on examining backlog items from three different perspectives:

- the **CU**stomer perspective
- the **BU**siness perspective and
- the **DE**velopment efforts perspective

<!--
It thus incorporates the inputs from the three most relevant perspectives: 
- the user experience specialist for the customer perspective,
- the product manager / product owner for the business perspective, and
- the development lead / architect for the development perspective
-->

The name CUBUDE is derived by taking the first two letters from each perspective. It is a great aid for memorizing the perspectives more easily and the order in which they should be examined.

## Goals and Constraints for Prioritization

The goals that should be reflected in the prioritization typically are

1. maximization of customer value
2. maximization of business value
3. minimization of development efforts

On the other hands, there can be constraints such as

- technical dependencies
- external dependencies

## The Customer Perspective

In order to be successful with your product or service, it is of utmost importance that it delivers **value** to your customers and its users. 

The CUBUDE method provides a sound approach for identifying and categorizing user needs as well as gaps and opportunities in your offering. 

## The Business Perspective

Businesses require revenues to fund activities such as research, development and operations.

And revenues are obtained from existing and new customers. 

While the interests of your customers and users should be aligned to the interests of your business, they are typically not the same. 

The CUBUDE method provides an approach to cluster work items into business value categories and measure their effect on your business. 

This helps to focus on your business interests whilst keeping an eye on your customer interests. 

## The Development Perspective

Typically, customer value cannot be created without spending efforts (aka "doing work"). 

For software-based products or services that are developed according to agile framework such as Scrum, development efforts are typically estimated in so-called story-points. 

## Bringing all perspectives together

By bringing together the insights from three different perspectives, it is possible to derive a priorization that supports the current goals for how to advance a product or service.

- creating packages of product backlog items for incremental release versions
- cross-checking Business Value and Development Efforts

## Summary

**Prioritizing work items** of a product backlog **requires substantial efforts** and is **not an easy task**. 

The **CUBUDE method** can greatly **help you** to **take more rationale prioritization decisions** by taking **different perspectives** into account. This helps you to **maximize your odds of success**. 

- **Goals** that should be reflected in the prioritization are the **maximization of customer value**, the **maximization of business value** and the **minimization of development efforts**.
- There exist **constraints** such as **technical** or **external dependencies** that also need to be taken into account. 
- **Examining** product backlog items **from different perspectives** creates transparency and insights for **taking better prioritization decisions**. 
- The three most relevant perspectives are the **customer perspective**, the **development perspective** and the **business perspective**.
