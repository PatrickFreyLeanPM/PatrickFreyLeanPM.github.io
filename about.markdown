I am a **passionate product manager** with over **15 years' experience**. I am working at [ETAS GmbH](http://www.etas.com){:target="_blank"}, a 100% subsidiary of [Bosch](http://www.bosch.com){:target="_blank"} [#likeabosch](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=likeabosch){:target="_blank"}. I have worked with cross-functional, interdisciplinary product teams building great tools that help automotive engineers to succeed with developing embedded software for future vehicles.

# Products / solutions I have led

I have gained most of my experience from working on the ETAS EHANDBOOK solution. [ETAS EHANDBOOK](http://www.etas.com/ehandbook){:target="_blank"} is an interactive documentation solution for automotive embedded software. 

It helps users to 
1. **find** relevant information quickly, 
2. **understand** dependencies more easily, and 
3. **get working tasks** done more efficiently. 

Check out what EHANDBOOK is all about: Understand vehicle software faster!

# My take on product management

In 2013, I had the luck to participate in a product management workshop led by Marty Cagan from [Silicon Valley Product Group (SPVG)](https://www.svpg.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

At that time, I was working as product manager on the first version of ETAS EHANDBOOK. 

In the workshop, Marty shared a lot of knowledge on how successful product teams work and create value for their customers. Besides the inspirational workshop, Marty also shared a copy of his book **Inspired: How to create products customers love.** with each of the participants. 

Marty's workshop was a spark. From then on, I was all on fire to become the best product manager  I can be. 
Besides Marty's book, I read a lot of [other books]({{ '/books' | relative_url }}) as well as articles I found on the internet - many of which I found useful for my work.

            10 years later, by end of 2022, I had the luck to attend the <b>Lean Product Management</b> training by <a href="https://itamargilad.com/" target="_blank">Itamar Gilad</a>.

Both Marty and Itamar have tons of experience on how to create successful software and tech products and businesses. To any aspiring product manager, I can only recommend to read their material, try out the methods they share, and - if possible - attend a training or workshop with them.
