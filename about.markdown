I am a passionate product manager with over 10 years' experience. I am working at [ETAS GmbH](http://www.etas.com), a 100% subsidiary of [Bosch](http://www.etas.com) #likeabosch. I have worked with cross-functional, interdisciplinary product teams building great tools that help automotive engineers to succeed with developing embedded software for future vehicles.

# Products / solutions I have led

I have gained most of my experience from working on the ETAS EHANDBOOK solution. [ETAS EHANDBOOK](http://www.etas.com/ehandbook) is an interactive documentation solution for automotive embedded software. 

It helps users to 
1. **find** relevant information quickly, 
2. **understand** dependencies more easily, and 
3. **get working tasks** done more efficiently. 

Check out what EHANDBOOK is all about: Understand vehicle software faster!

# My take on product management

In 2013, I had the luck to participate in a product management workshop led by Marty Cagan from [Silicon Valley Product Group (SPVG)](https://www.svpg.com/). 

At that time, I was working as product manager on the first version of ETAS EHANDBOOK. 

In the workshop, Marty shared a lot of knowledge on how successful product teams work and create value for its customers. Besides the inspirational workshop, Marty also shared a copy of his book **Inspired: How to create products customers love.** with each of the participants. 

10 years later, by end of 2022, I had the luck to attend the **Lean Product Management** training by [Itamar Gilad](https://itamargilad.com/). 

Both Marty and Itamar have tons of experience on how to create successful software and tech products and businesses. To any aspiring product manager, I can only recommend to read their material, try out the methods they share, and - if possible - attend a training or workshop with them.
