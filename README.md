# PatrickFreyLeanPM.com personal website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Jekyll sources of my personal website! This repository contains all the code and content that powers my site.

## About

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator that's perfect for personal projects, blogs, and more. Jekyll allows you to write content in Markdown, manage it with simple templates, and deploy it easily.
