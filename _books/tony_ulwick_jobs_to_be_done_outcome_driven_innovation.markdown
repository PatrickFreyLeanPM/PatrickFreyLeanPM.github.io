Tony Ulwick's work also had influence on other thought leaders such as Alex Osterwalder. 

In the foreword to Ulwick's book, Osterwalder writes: 

> I learned to appreciate Tony Ulwick’s work when I dove deeper into the Jobs-to-be-Done concept via Professor Clayton Christensen book, The Innovator’s Solution (Harvard Business School Press, 2003), and Tony’s article “The Customer-Centered Innovation Map” (Harvard Business Review, 2008). Subsequently, I discovered Strategyn’s powerful Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI) process that companies can use to effectively execute the innovation process. **Ultimately, this research led me and my team to design the Value Proposition Canvas**.

In the [Value Proposition Canvas]({{ '/books/alexander_osterwalder_value_proposition_design' | relative_url }}), the jobs section of the Customer Map clearly relates to Ulwick's jobs-to-be-done concepts.
