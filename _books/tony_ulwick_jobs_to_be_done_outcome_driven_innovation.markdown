In his seminal book, Tony Ulwick provides an overview on the the **Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Needs Framework** and **Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI)** process that he invented and brought to perfection.

Tony Ulwick's work also had influence on other thought leaders such as Alex Osterwalder. 

In the foreword to Ulwick's book, Osterwalder writes: 

> I learned to appreciate Tony Ulwick’s work when I dove deeper into the Jobs-to-be-Done concept via Professor Clayton Christensen book, The Innovator’s Solution (Harvard Business School Press, 2003), and Tony’s article “The Customer-Centered Innovation Map” (Harvard Business Review, 2008). Subsequently, I discovered Strategyn’s powerful Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI) process that companies can use to effectively execute the innovation process. **Ultimately, this research led me and my team to design the Value Proposition Canvas**.

In the [Value Proposition Canvas]({{ '/books/alexander_osterwalder_value_proposition_design' | relative_url }}), the jobs section of the Customer Map clearly relates to Ulwick's jobs-to-be-done concepts. 

## Key takeaways

### Chapter 1: Why do innovation projects fail?

In this chapter, Ulwick argues that 
- the **ideas-first approach** that is widely applied in innovation processes **is inherently flawed**. 
- the **needs-first approach** that is adopted by those who have understood the shortcomings of the earlier approach **is often flawed in execution**. The main reason for the latter is that **a common language for communicating a need does not exist**. 

> (...) despite all the talk about satisfying customer needs, **there is very little understanding of what characteristics a customer need statement should possess and what the structure, content, and
syntax of a need statement should be.**

> **How to get a handle on customer needs is an unsolved mystery—and that mystery is killing innovation.** _Before a company can succeed at innovation, managers must agree on what a need is—and the types of needs that customers have_. 

> The key to solving this mystery lies in **Jobs-to-be-Done Theory**.

### Chapter 2: Jobs-to-be-done needs framework

> **Jobs-to-be-Done Theory provides a framework for (i) categorizing, defining, capturing, and organizing all your customer’s needs, and (ii) tying customerdefined performance metrics (in the form of desired outcome statements) to the job-to-be-done.**

> Because customers are loyal to getting a job done, customers will switch to new solutions when they are able to get the job done significantly better. In our experience, new products that get the job done 20% better or more are very likely to win in the marketplace. Knowing that a product will get the job done 20% or more is the key to predictable innovation.

> This framework introduces the types of customer needs that must be considered to gain a deep understanding of what a customer is trying to accomplish. 
> They include 
* (i) the core functional job-to-be-done, 
* (ii) the desired outcomes tied to the core functional job-to-be-done, 
* (iii) related jobs, 
* (iv) emotional and social jobs, 
* (v) consumption chain jobs, and 
* (vi) the buyer’s financial desired outcomes.
