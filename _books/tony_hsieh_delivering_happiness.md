Zappos was an online shoe retailer founded by Tony Hsieh. It was sold to Amazon in 2009 for 1.2 billion USD. (I assume it was a good fit not only to Amazon's business model, but also a value-fit due to Zappos focus on customer happyness).

This book is all about Zappos company culture which was very different from many other companies, not so say crazy. It's fun to read.
