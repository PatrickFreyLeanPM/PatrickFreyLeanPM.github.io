"The Innovator's Dilemma" by Clayton M. Christensen delves into the complex realm of innovation, exploring the challenges faced by both disruptive and evolutionary product managers. Christensen's insights resonate deeply with my experience as a product manager primarily engaged in evolutionary innovation. His analysis of why well-managed companies can often fail to adapt to disruptive technologies provides valuable lessons for those, like me, navigating the evolving landscape of product development.

Christensen's exploration of the dilemma between sustaining and disruptive innovation offers a fresh perspective on the paths to success in product management. As someone who has primarily pursued evolutionary strategies, I found his examination of established companies' struggles to embrace new technologies particularly illuminating. While my focus has been on refining existing products, Christensen's book prompts me to consider the importance of balancing incremental improvements with the potential for disruptive shifts in the industry.

Ultimately, "The Innovator's Dilemma" has enriched my understanding of product management. Christensen's insights into the dynamics of innovation, while often centered on disruptive change, have provided me with valuable principles to enhance my approach to evolutionary product development. The book's lessons are a reminder that, even in the world of incremental innovation, it's crucial to remain attuned to market shifts and customer needs to ensure long-term success.
