"Nancy Duarte's 'Slideology' was an interesting read that provided valuable insights into creating visually engaging presentations. While I found the book to be informative and well-crafted, I must admit that I haven't fully integrated its principles into my day-to-day business practices as a product manager.

Duarte's emphasis on design principles and the art of slide creation was enlightening. The book offers a deep dive into techniques for enhancing slide aesthetics and structure, which I can see being particularly beneficial for crafting impactful presentations. However, in the hustle and bustle of my daily responsibilities, I haven't been able to implement these design-focused strategies as extensively as I initially intended.

Despite not fully adopting 'Slideology' into my routine, I do appreciate the knowledge gained from the book. It has broadened my understanding of effective presentation design and offered me a fresh perspective on how to engage and captivate audiences through visual storytelling. While I may not follow its principles rigorously in my day-to-day activities, I believe that the insights gained from 'Slideology' will continue to influence and inform my approach to communication and presentation in the long run."
